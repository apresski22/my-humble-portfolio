# my-humble-portfolio

This is the first portfolio project for the UTSA Full Stack Bootcamp and demonstrates the application of skills learned so far, such as HTML display and attributes, and styling of a webspage with CSS and inline HTML styling.

In order for the webpage to work as intended, there is an HTML file and an assets folder containing CSS and images subfolders. The style.css file is based off code presented throughout the second week of the course. The images are stock photos with the exception of the personal image.

To access webpage, it can be done directly through GitHub pages or using the following link.
