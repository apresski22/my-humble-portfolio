      <p>
        My first job was in high school working at Jack-in-the-Box. and when I
        was 19 I went into the Air Force where I became a Russian linguist. I
        was fortunate enough to be stationed in Hawaii for several years and
        cannot wait to go back and show my daughters the beauty of the islands.
        For the last 17 years I have been in San Antonio where I worked as a
        contractor doing cyber security and eventually ended up working with a
        squadron of really smart developers who reverse engineered malware!
        Throughout my career I have seen the need to implement and verify
        security in the software development process which leads me here today!
